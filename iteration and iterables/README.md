## What is Iteration?

Iteration means repeating something over and over. In programming, we often need to go through a collection of items (like a list) and do something with each item. Python makes this easy and elegant!

## Basic Loops

### For Loops
The most common way to iterate in Python:

```python
# Iterate through a list
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
# Output: apple, banana, cherry

# Iterate through a string
for letter in "hello":
    print(letter)
# Output: h, e, l, l, o
```

### While Loops
When you need to repeat until a condition is met:

```python
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(f"Count is: {count}")
    count += 1
```

## Built-in Iteration Tools

Python provides several helpful functions to make iteration easier:

### range() - Create Number Sequences
```python
# Basic range
for i in range(5):
    print(i)  # Prints: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

# Range with start and stop
for i in range(2, 8):
    print(i)  # Prints: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

# Range with step
for i in range(0, 10, 2):
    print(i)  # Prints: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8
```

### enumerate() - Get Index and Value
```python
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
    print(f"{index}: {fruit}")
# Output:
# 0: apple
# 1: banana
# 2: cherry
```

### zip() - Combine Multiple Lists
```python
names = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']
ages = [25, 30, 35]
cities = ['New York', 'London', 'Tokyo']

for name, age, city in zip(names, ages, cities):
    print(f"{name} is {age} years old and lives in {city}")
```

### reversed() - Go Backwards
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for num in reversed(numbers):
    print(num)  # Prints: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
```

### sorted() - Iterate in Order
```python
names = ['Charlie', 'Alice', 'Bob']
for name in sorted(names):
    print(name)  # Prints: Alice, Bob, Charlie
```

## Iterable Objects

An **iterable** is any object you can loop through. Python has many built-in iterables:

### Lists and Tuples
```python
# Lists (mutable)
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
for item in my_list:
    print(item)

# Tuples (immutable)
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4)
for item in my_tuple:
    print(item)
```

### Strings
```python
message = "Hello"
for character in message:
    print(character)  # Prints each letter
```

### Dictionaries
```python
student = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 20, 'grade': 'A'}

# Loop through keys
for key in student:
    print(key)  # name, age, grade

# Loop through values
for value in student.values():
    print(value)  # Alice, 20, A

# Loop through key-value pairs
for key, value in student.items():
    print(f"{key}: {value}")
```

### Sets
```python
colors = {'red', 'green', 'blue'}
for color in colors:
    print(color)  # Order may vary
```

## Understanding Iterators

- **Iterable**: Something you can loop through (like a list)
- **Iterator**: The actual object that keeps track of where you are in the loop

### Key Methods:
- `__iter__()`: Returns the iterator object
- `__next__()`: Returns the next item in the sequence

```python
# A list is iterable but NOT an iterator
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
print(hasattr(my_list, '__iter__'))  # True - it's iterable
print(hasattr(my_list, '__next__'))  # False - it's NOT an iterator

# Get an iterator from the list
my_iterator = iter(my_list)
print(hasattr(my_iterator, '__iter__'))  # True
print(hasattr(my_iterator, '__next__'))  # True - now it's an iterator!

# Use the iterator manually with next()
print(next(my_iterator))  # 1
print(next(my_iterator))  # 2
print(next(my_iterator))  # 3
# next(my_iterator)  # Would raise StopIteration error

# Example of how for loops work behind the scenes:
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_iter = iter(my_list)
while True:
    try:
        item = next(my_iter)
        print(item)
    except StopIteration:
        break  # End of iteration
```

## Advanced Tools (itertools)

The `itertools` module provides powerful iteration tools:

```python
import itertools

# Count infinitely (be careful!)
counter = itertools.count(1, 2)  # Start at 1, step by 2
for i, num in enumerate(counter):
    if i >= 5:  # Stop after 5 iterations
        break
    print(num)  # 1, 3, 5, 7, 9

# Cycle through a sequence
colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue']
color_cycle = itertools.cycle(colors)
for i, color in enumerate(color_cycle):
    if i >= 7:  # Stop after 7 iterations
        break
    print(color)  # red, green, blue, red, green, blue, red

# Chain multiple iterables together
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = [4, 5, 6]
for item in itertools.chain(list1, list2):
    print(item)  # 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

# Get combinations
for combo in itertools.combinations([1, 2, 3, 4], 2):
    print(combo)  # (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4)
```

## Creating Your Own Iterables

### Method 1: Using __iter__ and __next__
```python
class CountDown:
    def __init__(self, start):
        self.start = start
        self.current = start
    
    def __iter__(self):
        return self
    
    def __next__(self):
        if self.current <= 0:
            raise StopIteration
        self.current -= 1
        return self.current + 1

# Usage
countdown = CountDown(5)
for num in countdown:
    print(num)  # 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

# You can also use it manually
countdown2 = CountDown(3)
print(next(countdown2))  # 3
print(next(countdown2))  # 2
print(next(countdown2))  # 1
# print(next(countdown2))  # Would raise StopIteration
```

### Method 2: Separate Iterator Class
```python
class NumberRange:
    def __init__(self, start, end):
        self.start = start
        self.end = end
    
    def __iter__(self):
        return NumberIterator(self.start, self.end)

class NumberIterator:
    def __init__(self, start, end):
        self.current = start
        self.end = end
    
    def __iter__(self):
        return self
    
    def __next__(self):
        if self.current >= self.end:
            raise StopIteration
        result = self.current
        self.current += 1
        return result

# Usage
num_range = NumberRange(1, 5)
for num in num_range:
    print(num)  # 1, 2, 3, 4

# You can create multiple iterators from the same iterable
for num in num_range:  # Works again!
    print(f"Second time: {num}")
```

### Method 3: Using Generator Functions (Easier!)
```python
class CountDownGenerator:
    def __init__(self, start):
        self.start = start
    
    def __iter__(self):
        current = self.start
        while current > 0:
            yield current
            current -= 1

# Usage
countdown = CountDownGenerator(5)
for num in countdown:
    print(num)  # 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
```

### Using Generator Functions (Easier!)
```python
def fibonacci_numbers(count):
    """Generate the first 'count' Fibonacci numbers"""
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(count):
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b

# Usage
for num in fibonacci_numbers(10):
    print(num)  # 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34
```

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Processing a Shopping List
```python
shopping_list = ['apples', 'bread', 'milk', 'eggs']
prices = [3.50, 2.00, 4.25, 2.75]

print("Shopping List:")
total_cost = 0
for i, (item, price) in enumerate(zip(shopping_list, prices), 1):
    print(f"{i}. {item.title()}: ${price:.2f}")
    total_cost += price

print(f"\nTotal cost: ${total_cost:.2f}")
```

### Example 4: Custom Iterator for Even Numbers
```python
class EvenNumbers:
    def __init__(self, max_num):
        self.max_num = max_num
    
    def __iter__(self):
        self.current = 0
        return self
    
    def __next__(self):
        while self.current <= self.max_num:
            if self.current % 2 == 0:
                result = self.current
                self.current += 1
                return result
            self.current += 1
        raise StopIteration

# Usage
evens = EvenNumbers(10)
for num in evens:
    print(num)  # 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10

# Manual usage
evens2 = EvenNumbers(6)
iterator = iter(evens2)
print(next(iterator))  # 0
print(next(iterator))  # 2
print(next(iterator))  # 4
```
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Method 1: Using a regular loop
even_numbers = []
for num in numbers:
    if num % 2 == 0:
        even_numbers.append(num)

print("Even numbers:", even_numbers)

# Method 2: Using list comprehension (more Pythonic)
even_numbers = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
print("Even numbers:", even_numbers)
```

### Example 6: Working with Files
```python
# Reading a file line by line (files are iterable!)
try:
    with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
        for line_number, line in enumerate(file, 1):
            print(f"Line {line_number}: {line.strip()}")
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File not found!")
```

## Tips for Beginners

### 1. Choose the Right Tool
- Use `range()` when you need numbers
- Use `enumerate()` when you need both index and value
- Use `zip()` when working with multiple lists
- Use `reversed()` to go backwards

### 2. List Comprehensions are Pythonic
```python
# Instead of this:
squares = []
for x in range(10):
    squares.append(x**2)

# Do this:
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
```

### 3. Check if Something is Iterable
```python
def is_iterable(obj):
    try:
        iter(obj)
        return True
    except TypeError:
        return False

print(is_iterable([1, 2, 3]))    # True
print(is_iterable("hello"))      # True
print(is_iterable(42))           # False
```

### 4. Be Careful with Infinite Iterators
Some tools like `itertools.count()` create infinite sequences. Always have a way to stop!

### 5. Practice Makes Perfect
Try these exercises:
- Create a function that prints numbers from 1 to n
- Write a program that finds all words in a sentence longer than 5 characters
- Make a simple gradebook that calculates average scores

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Modifying a list while iterating over it** - This can cause unexpected behavior
2. **Forgetting that dictionaries don't have a guaranteed order** (in older Python versions)
3. **Not handling StopIteration when using next() manually**
4. **Creating infinite loops with itertools functions**

## Conclusion

Iteration is fundamental to Python programming. Master these concepts and you'll write cleaner, more efficient code. Start with the basics (for loops, range, enumerate) and gradually explore more advanced tools as you become comfortable.

Remember: Python's iteration tools are designed to make your code more readable and efficient. When in doubt, choose the most readable option!
